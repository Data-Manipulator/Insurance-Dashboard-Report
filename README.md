## Introduction
The Insurance Dashboard is a project that aims to explore the relationships between different factors and insurance charges. The project uses the Insurance dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about individuals and their insurance policies, including various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

## Dataset
The Insurance dataset contains 1338 observations and 7 features, including:
Age: Age of the individual
Sex: Gender of the individual
BMI: Body mass index of the individual
Children: Number of children the individual has
Smoker: Smoking status of the individual
Region: Region the individual is from
Charges: Insurance charges for the individual

## Main Goal
The main goal of this project is to explore the relationships between the features and the insurance charges, and to build predictive models that can accurately predict insurance charges based on the available features. This can help insurance companies to better understand the factors that contribute to higher insurance charges and to develop more accurate pricing models.

## Analysis
The analysis of the Insurance dataset revealed several insights, including:
Age is positively correlated with insurance charges, indicating that as individuals get older, their insurance charges tend to increase.
Smokers have higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers.
Individuals in different regions have different average insurance charges, with individuals in the southeast region having the highest average insurance charges.

## Predictive Models
The project also includes the development of predictive models, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, to accurately predict insurance charges based on the available features.

## Future Work
There are several areas of future work for the Insurance Dashboard project, including:
Exploring the relationship between BMI and insurance charges
Investigating the impact of having children on insurance charges
Developing more advanced predictive models, such as deep learning models.

## Conclusion
The Insurance Dashboard project provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to higher insurance charges and can help insurance companies to develop more accurate pricing models. By using the available features, the project also demonstrates the development of predictive models that can accurately predict insurance charges for individuals.
